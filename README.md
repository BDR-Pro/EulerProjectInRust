# Project Euler in Rust: A Gen Z Guide ðŸš€

Hey fam! Welcome to the sickest coding journey where we're about to dive deep into the world of Project Euler, but with a twist â€“ we're doing it in Rust! ðŸ¦€

## What's Project Euler? ðŸ¤”

Imagine a collection of brain-teasing math problems that are like the boss level in video games but for coding. That's Project Euler. It's where math meets coding in a battle royale style, challenging you to flex those brain muscles and coding skills simultaneously.

## Why Rust, Though? ðŸ¦€

Rust is like the superhero of programming languages. It's fast, reliable, and prevents you from making silly mistakes (goodbye, unexpected crashes!). By solving Project Euler problems in Rust, not only do you get to solve cool puzzles but also learn a language that's as sturdy as Thor's hammer but as precise as Hawkeye.

## Getting Started ðŸš€

### Install Rust

First things first, let's get Rusty! Install Rust by visiting [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). It's like getting your digital toolbox ready.

### Clone This Repo

Git clone this repo to dive into the problems. It's like stepping into the dojo to start your training.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BDR-Pro/EulerProjectInRust.git
cd EulerProjectInRust
```

### Battle Each Problem

Navigate to each problem like you're choosing your battles.

```bash
cp src/factorial.rs main.rs
cargo run
```

### The Rusty Way ðŸ› 

Rust has some cool features like ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes, making your code not just correct but also efficient. It's like learning to fight smart, not hard.

## Tips for Surviving the Euler Arena ðŸ›¡

- **Stay Calm and Rusty**: Some problems are tough. Take a break, hydrate, and come back with fresh eyes.
- **Community is Key**: Stuck? The Rust community and Project Euler forums are like your guild; they've got your back.
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: The more you code, the better you get. It's like leveling up in a game.

## Why You Should Care âœ¨

Solving Project Euler problems in Rust isn't just about bragging rights (though they are pretty cool). It's about sharpening your problem-solving skills, diving deep into math, and mastering a language that's built for speed and safety. It's like training to be a math wizard and coding ninja all in one.

So, what are you waiting for? Let's get Rusty and conquer Project Euler, one problem at a time! ðŸš€ðŸ¦€
